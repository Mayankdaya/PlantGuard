# üå± PlantGuard Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ Current Status: DEPLOYMENT INITIATED

### What Has Been Completed:

1. **‚úÖ Render CLI Setup**
   - Render CLI v1.1.0 successfully installed and configured
   - Login completed successfully with authentication token saved
   - CLI is functional and ready for operations

2. **‚úÖ Deployment Configuration**
   - `render.yaml` configuration file created and validated
   - Configuration includes:
     - Service name: `plantguard`
     - Environment: Python
     - Root directory: `Flask Deployed App`
     - Build and start commands configured
     - Environment variables set (Python 3.10.13, production mode)
     - Auto-deployment enabled

3. **‚úÖ Code Repository Ready**
   - All deployment scripts created and tested
   - Code successfully pushed to GitHub repository
   - Git integration ready for automatic deployment

4. **‚úÖ Application Structure Verified**
   - Flask application files present in `Flask Deployed App/` directory
   - Requirements.txt available for dependency installation
   - Model file reference configured (with fallback download option)

### üîß Deployment Configuration Details:

```yaml
# render.yaml - Service Configuration
Service Name: plantguard
Type: Web Service
Environment: Python
Plan: Free
Root Directory: Flask Deployed App
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt + model validation
Start Command: gunicorn -w 2 -k gthread -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
Auto Deploy: Enabled
```

### üöÄ Next Steps:

1. **Monitor Render Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Look for the `plantguard` service in your dashboard
   - Monitor deployment progress and logs

2. **Service Creation Process**
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
   - Service will be created with the specified configuration
   - Initial deployment will be triggered automatically

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Once deployed, test the application URL
   - Verify model loading and prediction functionality
   - Monitor application logs for any issues

### üìä Deployment Scripts Available:

- `check_status.bat` - Quick deployment status check
- `render_login_basic.ps1` - Render CLI login script
- `deploy_render_cli.ps1` - Full deployment automation script
- `render.yaml` - Render service configuration

### üîç Monitoring Commands:

```bash
# Check service status (once workspace is set)
render services list

# View service logs
render logs --service plantguard

# Check deployment status
render deploys list --service plantguard
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

1. **Model File**: The deployment includes logic to handle the plant disease model file:
   - If `plant_disease_model_1.pt` exists in the repository, it will be used
   - If not found, it will attempt to download from a provided URL (MODEL_URL environment variable)
   - Ensure the model file is accessible for the application to function properly

2. **Workspace Configuration**: The Render CLI requires a workspace to be set for full functionality. This can be configured through the Render dashboard.

3. **Auto-Deployment**: With auto-deploy enabled, any future pushes to the main branch will automatically trigger new deployments.

### üéØ Expected Outcome:

Once the deployment completes successfully:
- PlantGuard application will be accessible via a public URL
- Plant disease prediction functionality will be available
- Application will be running in production mode
- Service will be monitored and managed through Render dashboard

**Status**: ‚úÖ Deployment Process Initiated Successfully
**Next Action**: Monitor Render Dashboard for service creation and deployment progress
